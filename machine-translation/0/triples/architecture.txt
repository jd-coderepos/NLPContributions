(Contribution||has||neural network architecture)
(neural network architecture||called||RNN Encoder-Decoder)
(neural network architecture||consists of||two recurrent neural networks (RNN))
(two recurrent neural networks (RNN)||trained||jointly)
(jointly||to maximize||conditional probability of the target sequence given a source sequence)
(two recurrent neural networks (RNN)||act as||encoder)
(encoder||maps||a variable-length source sequence to a fixed-length vector)
(two recurrent neural networks (RNN)||act as||decoder)
(decoder||maps||the vector representation back to a variable-length target sequence)
(neural network architecture||propose||sophisticated hidden unit)
(sophisticated hidden unit||to improve||both the memory capacity and the ease of training)
