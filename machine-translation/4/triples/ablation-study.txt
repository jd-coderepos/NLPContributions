(Contribution||has||Ablation study)
(Ablation study||most critical component||weight-sharing constraint)
(weight-sharing constraint||is vital to map||sentences of different languages to the shared-latent space)
(Ablation study||significantly improve||translation performance of our system)
(translation performance of our system||by||The GANs)
(Ablation study||remove||directional self-attention)
(directional self-attention||get||-0.3 BLEU points decline)
