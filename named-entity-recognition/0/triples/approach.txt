(Contribution||has||method)
(method||called||accelerated robust subset selection)
(method||use||lp(0<p<=1)-norm based measure)
(lp(0<p<=1)-norm based measure||for||representation loss)
(method||propose||speedup solver)
(speedup solver||based on||data size is generally much larger than feature length)
(speedup solver||has||acceleration)
(acceleration||owing to||Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM))
(acceleration||owing to||equivalent derivation)
