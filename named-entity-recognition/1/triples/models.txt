(Contribution||has||Models)
(Models||is||LSTM-CRF)
(LSTM-CRF||is||a bidirectional LSTM)
(a bidirectional LSTM||above it||sequential conditional random layer)
(Models||is||S-LSTM)
(S-LSTM||use||character-based word representation model)
(character-based word representation model||to capture||orthographic sensitivity)
(character-based word representation model||combine||distributional representations)
(S-LSTM||constructs and labels||chunks of input sentences)
(chunks of input sentences||using||algorithm inspired by transition-based parsing with states represented by stack LSTMs)
