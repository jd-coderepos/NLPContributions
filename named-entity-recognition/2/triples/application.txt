(Contribution||has||Application)
(Application||called||iterated dilated CNN architecture (ID-CNN))
(iterated dilated CNN architecture (ID-CNN)||applies||same block of dilated convolutions)
(same block of dilated convolutions||provides opportunities||to inject supervision on intermediate activations of the network)
(same block of dilated convolutions||prevents||overfitting)
(same block of dilated convolutions||to||token-wise representation)
(Application||of||dilated convolutions)
(dilated convolutions||skips over||every dilation width d inputs)
(dilated convolutions||operate on||sliding window of context)
(sliding window of context||over||sequence)
(dilated convolutions||for||sequence labeling)
(dilated convolutions||stacking layers||of)
(of||exponentially increasing dilation width||expand this size)
(expand this size||effective input width||to cover)
(to cover||entire length||of most sequences)
(Application||has||two methods)
(two methods||for||performing prediction)
(performing prediction||predict||each token's label independently)
(performing prediction||by running||Viterbi inference)
(Viterbi inference||in||chain structured graphical model)
