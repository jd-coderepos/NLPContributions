(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||view||whole sentence as single state)
(whole sentence as single state||consists of||sub-states for individual words and an overall sentence-level state)
(Model||at each recurrent step||information exchange)
(information exchange||conducted between||consecutive words in the sentence, and between the sentence-level state and each word)
(information exchange||receives||each word)
(each word||from||predecessor and successor simultaneously)
(Model||to capture||local and non-local contexts)
(local and non-local contexts||updated recurrently||states)
(states||by||exchanging information)
(Model||is||an alternative neural network structure)
(Model||to model||hidden states of all words simultaneously)
(hidden states of all words simultaneously||at||each recurrent step)
