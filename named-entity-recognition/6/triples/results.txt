(Results||on||CoNLL)
(CoNLL||matches state-of-the-art performances||complex architectures)
(CoNLL||matches state-of-the-art performances||more elaborate features)
(CoNLL||significantly outperforms||models that use extensive sets of hand-crafted features)
(CoNLL||significantly outperforms||system of (Luo et al., 2015) that uses NE and Entity Linking annotations to jointly optimize the performance on both tasks)
(CoNLL||outperforms||other NN models that only use standard word embeddings)
(other NN models that only use standard word embeddings||indicates||our lexical feature vector is complementary to standard word embeddings)
(Results||on||OntoNotes)
(OntoNotes||surpasses||systems with hand-crafted features, including Ratinov and Roth (2009) that use gazetteers)
(OntoNotes||surpasses||system of Durrett and Klein (2014))
(system of Durrett and Klein (2014)||uses||coreference annotation in ONTONOTES)
(coreference annotation in ONTONOTES||to jointly model||NER, entity linking, and coreference resolution tasks)
(OntoNotes||significantly outperforms||Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF models of (Chiu and Nichols, 2016) and (Strubell et al., 2017))
(Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF models of (Chiu and Nichols, 2016) and (Strubell et al., 2017)||by||an absolute gain of 1.68 and 0.96 points respectively)
