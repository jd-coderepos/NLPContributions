(Contribution||has||System)
(System||employ||Stack-LSTM)
(Stack-LSTM||incorporate||character-level LSTM)
(character-level LSTM||help deal with||out-of-vocabulary problem of neural models)
(character-level LSTM||to capture||morphological information)
(Stack-LSTM||to represent||system's state)
(system's state||consists of||states of input, stack and action history)
(states of input, stack and action history||in||continuous space incrementally)
(Stack-LSTM||encoded||(partially) processed nested mentions)
((partially) processed nested mentions||with||recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013))
(System||design||transition-based system)
(transition-based system||to achieve||scalable and effective solution)
(scalable and effective solution||for recognizing||nested mentions)
(System||mapped||each sentence with nested mentions)
(each sentence with nested mentions||to||forest where each outermost mention forms a tree consisting of its inner mentions)
(forest where each outermost mention forms a tree consisting of its inner mentions||learns to construct||through a sequence of shift-reduce actions)
