(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||converting questions||to (un-interpretable) vectorial representations)
(to (un-interpretable) vectorial representations||can query||any KB)
(any KB||independent of||schema)
(to (un-interpretable) vectorial representations||which require||no pre-defined grammars or lexicons)
(Approach||make use of||weak supervision)
(Approach||learning||low-dimensional vector embeddings)
(low-dimensional vector embeddings||of||word and of KB triples)
(word and of KB triples||so that||representations of questions and corresponding answers)
(representations of questions and corresponding answers||end up||similar)
(similar||in||embedding space)
(Approach||propose||fine-tune embedding-based models)
(fine-tune embedding-based models||by carefully optimizing||a matrix)
(a matrix||parameterizing||similarity used in the embedding space)
(similarity used in the embedding space||leading to||consistent improvement in performance)
