(Contribution||has||Experimental setup)
(Experimental setup||found||max function)
(max function||worked better than||global function)
(Experimental setup||use||local-3 function)
(Experimental setup||tested||influence of various filter types)
(influence of various filter types||constructed||5 groups of filters)
(5 groups of filters||called||win-l)
(win-l||contains||only the unigram filters)
(5 groups of filters||called||win-2)
(win-2||contains||both unigram and bigram filters)
(5 groups of filters||called||win-3)
(win-3||contains||all the filters in win-2 plus trigram filters)
(5 groups of filters||called||win-4)
(win-4||extends filters in||win-3 with 4-gram filters)
(5 groups of filters||called||win-5)
(win-5||adds||5-gram filters into win-4)
(Experimental setup||switched||semantic matching functions)
(semantic matching functions||among||{max, global, local-l})
(Experimental setup||varied||decomposition operation)
(decomposition operation||among||{rigid, linear, orthogonal})
(Experimental setup||fixed||linear decomposition)
(Experimental setup||fixed||filter types)
(filter types||including||{unigram, bigram, trigram})
(filter types||filters||500)
