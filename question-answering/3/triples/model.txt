(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||given||a sentence pair)
(a sentence pair||represents||each word)
(each word||as||a low-dimensional vector)
(a sentence pair||calculates||semantic matching vector)
(semantic matching vector||for||each word)
(each word||based on||all words in the other sentence)
(Model||decomposing and composing||lexical semantics)
(lexical semantics||over||sentences)
(Model||based on||semantic matching vector)
(semantic matching vector||decomposed||each word vector)
(each word vector||into||two components)
(two components||called||similar component)
(similar component||of||all the words)
(all the words||to represent||similar parts of the sentence pair)
(two components||called||dissimilar component)
(dissimilar component||of||every word)
(every word||to model||dissimilar parts explicitly)
(Model||performed||two-channel CNN operation)
(two-channel CNN operation||to compose||similar and dissimilar components into a feature vector)
(Model||utilized||composed feature vector)
(composed feature vector||to predict||sentence similarity)
