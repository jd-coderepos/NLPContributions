(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||use||sliding window)
(sliding window||is||word-level sliding window)
(word-level sliding window||operates on||two different views of text sentences)
(two different views of text sentences||called||sequential view)
(sequential view||where||words appear in their natural order)
(two different views of text sentences||called||dependency view)
(dependency view||where||words are reordered based on a linearization of the sentence's dependency graph)
(sliding window||implicitly considers||linear distance between matched words)
(Model||has||word-by-word perspective)
(word-by-word perspective||focuses on||similarity matches)
(similarity matches||between||individual words from hypothesis and text, at various scales)
(Model||has||semantic perspective)
(semantic perspective||compares||hypothesis to sentences in the text viewed as single, self-contained thoughts)
(hypothesis to sentences in the text viewed as single, self-contained thoughts||represented using||sum and transformation of word embedding vectors)
(Model||compares||question and answer candidates to the text)
(question and answer candidates to the text||using||several different perspectives)
