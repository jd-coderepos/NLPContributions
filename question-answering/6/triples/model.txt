(Model||called||Query-Reduction Network (QRN))
(Query-Reduction Network (QRN)||considers||context sentences)
(context sentences||as a||sequence of state-changing triggers)
(Query-Reduction Network (QRN)||transforms||original query)
(original query||observes||each trigger through time)
(original query||to||more informed query)
(Query-Reduction Network (QRN)||is a||single recurrent unit)
(single recurrent unit||addresses||long-term dependency problem of most RNN-based models)
(long-term dependency problem of most RNN-based models||by||simplifying the recurrent update)
(long-term dependency problem of most RNN-based models||while||taking the advantage of RNN's capability)
(taking the advantage of RNN's capability||to model||sequential data)
