(Model||from sentence||Our model allows joint modeling of entities and relations in a single model by using both bidirectional sequential (left-to-right and right-to-left) and bidirectional tree-structured (bottom-up and top-down) LSTMRNNs.)

(NN parameters||using||both entity and relation labels)
(Model||from sentence||Our model first detects entities and then extracts relations between the detected entities using a single incrementally-decoded NN structure, and the NN parameters are jointly updated using both entity and relation labels.)

(Model||from sentence||Unlike traditional incremental end-to-end relation extraction models, our model further incorporates two enhancements into training: entity pretraining, which pretrains the entity model, and scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015), which replaces (unreliable) predicted labels with gold labels in a certain probability. These enhancements alleviate the problem of low-performance entity detection in early stages of training, as well as allow entity information to further help downstream relation classification.)
