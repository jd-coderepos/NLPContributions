(ablation tests||on||ACE04 dataset)
(ACE04 dataset||from sentence||We conduct ablation tests on the ACE04 dataset reported in Table 2 to analyze the effectiveness of the various parts of our joint model. The performance of the RE task decreases (~1% in terms of F1 score) when we remove the label embeddings layer and only use the LSTM hidden states as inputs for the RE task.)

(ACE04 dataset||from sentence||Removing character embeddings also degrades the performance of both NER (~1%) and RE (~2%) tasks by a relatively large margin.)

(ablation tests||from sentence||Finally, we conduct experiments for the NER task by removing the CRF loss layer and substituting it with a softmax. Assuming independent distribution of labels (i.e., softmax) leads to a slight decrease in the F1 performance of the NER module and a ~2% decrease in the performance of the RE task.)
