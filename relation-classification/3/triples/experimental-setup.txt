(Contribution||has||Experimental setup)
(Experimental setup||employ||early stopping)
(Experimental setup||use||Adam optimizer)
(Experimental setup||use||S(trict))
(S(trict)||has description||we score an entity as correct if both the entity boundaries and the entity type are correct)
(Experimental setup||use||B(oundaries))
(B(oundaries)||has description||we score an entity as correct if only the entity boundaries are correct while the entity type is not taken into account)
(Experimental setup||use||R(elaxed))
(R(elaxed)||has description||a multi-token entity is considered correct if at least one correct type is assigned to the tokens comprising the entity, assuming that the boundaries are known)
(Experimental setup||evaluate||four datatsets)
(Experimental setup||evaluate||NER task)
(NER task||using||10-fold cross validation)
(NER task||similar to||Miwa and Sasaki (2014))
(Experimental setup||evaluate||Dutch Real Estate Classifieds, DREC (Bekoulis et al., 2017) dataset)
(Experimental setup||evaluate||Adverse Drug Events, ADE (Gurulingappa et al., 2012))
(Adverse Drug Events, ADE (Gurulingappa et al., 2012)||perform||10-fold cross-validation similar to Li et al. (2017))
