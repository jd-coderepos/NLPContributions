(baseline model||from sentence||The baseline model, described in detail in Bekoulis et al. (2018b), is illustrated in Fig. 1. It aims to detect (i) the type and the boundaries of the entities and (ii) the relations between them.)

(baseline model||from sentence||For the NER task, we adopt the BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) encoding scheme.)
