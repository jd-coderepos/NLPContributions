(Ablation Analysis||on||TACRED dev set)
(TACRED dev set||from||entity representations and feedforward layers)
(entity representations and feedforward layers||contribute||1.0 F1)
(TACRED dev set||remove||dependency structure)
(dependency structure||score drops||by 3.2 F1)
(TACRED dev set||remove||the feedforward layers, the LSTM component and the dependency structure)
(the feedforward layers, the LSTM component and the dependency structure||F1 drops||by 10.3)
(TACRED dev set||removing||pruning (i.e., using full trees as input))
(pruning (i.e., using full trees as input)||hurts the result||by another 9.7 F1)
