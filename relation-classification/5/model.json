Our NER component employs a BiLSTM-CRF architecture [10] to predict entities from input word tokens. Based on both the input words and the predicted NER labels, the RC component uses another BiLSTM to learn latent features relevant for relation classification. In contrast, our RC component takes into account second-order interactions over the latent features via a tensor. In particular, for relation classification we propose a novel use of the deep biaffine attention mechanism [7] which was first introduced in dependency parsing."
