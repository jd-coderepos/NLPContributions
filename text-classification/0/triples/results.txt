(Contribution||has||Results)
(Results||may not give us an advantage||simple use of a distributed word representation)
(simple use of a distributed word representation||to||text classification)
(Results||most obvious trend||larger datasets tend to perform better)
(Results||most important conclusion from our experiments||character-level ConvNets could work for text classification)
(character-level ConvNets could work for text classification||without||the need for words)
(Results||to validate the hypothesis||further analysis is needed)
(further analysis is needed||that ConvNets||are truly good)
(are truly good||at identifying||exotic character combination)
(exotic character combination||such as||misspellings and emoticons)
