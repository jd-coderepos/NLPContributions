(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||learn||context-sensitive convolutional filters)
(context-sensitive convolutional filters||for||natural language understanding)
(Approach||vary||learned filters)
(learned filters||allow||fine-grained feature abstraction)
(learned filters||from||sentence to sentence)
(Approach||introduce||meta network)
(meta network||to generate||set of context-sensitive filters)
(set of context-sensitive filters||conditioned on||specific input sentences)
(Approach||does not have||fixed set of filters)
(fixed set of filters||provides the network||stronger modeling flexibility and capacity)
(Approach||propose||a novel bidirectional filter generation mechanism)
(a novel bidirectional filter generation mechanism||to allow||interactions between sentence pairs)
(interactions between sentence pairs||while constructing||context-sensitive representations)
