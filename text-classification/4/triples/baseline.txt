(Contribution||has||Baselines)
(Baselines||consider||ngrams (Zhang et al., 2015))
(ngrams (Zhang et al., 2015)||has description||a bag-of-means method based on TFIDF representations built by choosing the 500,000 most frequent n-grams (up to 5-grams) from the training set and use their corresponding counts as features)
(Baselines||consider||small/large word CNN (Zhang et al., 2015))
(small/large word CNN (Zhang et al., 2015)||has description||6 layer word-based convolutional networks, with 256/1024 features at each layer, denoted as small/large, respectively)
(Baselines||consider||deep CNN (Conneau et al., 2016))
(deep CNN (Conneau et al., 2016)||has description||deep convolutional neural networks with 9/17/29 layers)
