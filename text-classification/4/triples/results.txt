(Answer Sentence Selection||significantly better results than||attentive pooling network)
(Answer Sentence Selection||significantly better results than||ABCNN (attention-based CNN))
(Results||for||Document Classification)
(Document Classification||achieves slightly better performance than||self-attentive sentence embeddings)
(self-attentive sentence embeddings||by||our M-ACNN)
