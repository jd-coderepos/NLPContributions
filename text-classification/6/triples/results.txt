(Contribution||has||Results)
(Results||perform better||Models that make use of sentence level transfer learning)
(Models that make use of sentence level transfer learning||than||models that only use word level transfer)
(Results||approach the performance||models that do not make use of transfer learning)
(models that do not make use of transfer learning||of||other models)
(other models||as||training set size increases)
(Results||achieve surprisingly good task performance||sentence level transfer learning)
(sentence level transfer learning||for||smaller quantities of data)
(Results||performs as good or better||transfer learning from the transformer based sentence encoder)
(transfer learning from the transformer based sentence encoder||than||transfer learning from the DAN encoder)
