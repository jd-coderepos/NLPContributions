(Contribution||has||Approach)
(Approach||compare||SWEM-based models)
(SWEM-based models||with||existing recurrent and convolutional networks)
(existing recurrent and convolutional networks||in a||point-by-point manner)
(point-by-point manner||To account for||distinct nature of various NLP tasks)
(distinct nature of various NLP tasks||may require||different semantic features)
(Approach||conduct||extensive experimental investigation)
