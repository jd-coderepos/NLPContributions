(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||computes||two sentence usability metrics)
(two sentence usability metrics||called||relative usability)
(relative usability||has description||weighs the confidence of using sentence a in fixing sentence b)
(two sentence usability metrics||called||self usability)
(self usability||has description||weighs the confidence of using sentence a in solving the task)
(two sentence usability metrics||to control||noise)
(noise||when||fixing vectors)
(Model||Fixing the vectors||is done)
(is done||by||selectively moving vectors)
(selectively moving vectors||to location||in same vector space)
(in same vector space||better separates||the class)
(Model||present||neural attention-based multiple context fixing attachment (MCFA))
(neural attention-based multiple context fixing attachment (MCFA)||is||series of modules)
(series of modules||uses||all the sentence vectors (e.g. Arabic, English, Korean, etc.))
(all the sentence vectors (e.g. Arabic, English, Korean, etc.)||as||context)
(all the sentence vectors (e.g. Arabic, English, Korean, etc.)||to fix||a sentence vector (e.g. Korean))
